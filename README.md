[Deployed Project]()

![Screenshot will go here]()

## Overview

This project is an employee directory built with React, allowing the UI to:

* Exist as unique components
* Manage component states on an individual basis
* Respond to user events

Employee data is generated using the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) and accessed via the [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) NodeJS package.

Deployment done via GitHub Pages

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to:

* View my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
* Sort the table by at least one category
* Filter the users by at least one property.
